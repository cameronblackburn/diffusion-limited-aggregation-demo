# Introduction

This is a Diffusion Limited Aggregation (DLA) based model which has been tailored to somewhat mimic mycelial networks / slime moulds.

The model works on a reversal of DLA, branching outwards to create fractal patterns which lead to an organic webbing pattern. Walkers are attracted to food and will move towards them when in a given radius.

DLA was chosen to try to get a random organic feel to the simulation with pathfinding included to increase slime mould likeness. Slime Mould Algorithms (SMA) could have been used instead, although I wanted to see if I could create something similar using DLA and attempting to turn it into something that resembles slime moulds, fascinating creatures. This project is a chance for me to both improve my programming skills and learn more about these little problem-solvers!
